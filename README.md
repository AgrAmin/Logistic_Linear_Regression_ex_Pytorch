# Logistic_Linear_Regression_ex_Pytorch

Pytorch example code : Logistic Linear regression for binary classification
I added the treshold manually (calclated according to the mean). I am not too confident in this step as I didn't see in other projects
The result seems correct and the algorithm give the best outcome.
Histogram Plot part is to visulize the features after normalization. It gives an idea wether there is a corrolation beteween features (method recommended in udemy course)
